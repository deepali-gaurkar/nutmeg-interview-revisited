# Nutmeg Interview - Java API Practice

This project is a re-implementation of a REST API problem I encountered during an interview with Nutmeg. I struggled during the live interview, so I decided to revisit the problem in my own time using core Java, Gson, and HttpClient to strengthen my understanding of REST APIs, JSON parsing, and Java Streams.

The project fetches TV series data from a mock API and filters results based on IMDb ratings and genres.
